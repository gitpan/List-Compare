	- documentation changes

0.08  Sat Jun 15 2002
	- added method get_version()
	- used non-idiomatic syntax for 'foreach' in hope of making module more backwardly compatible
	- to free up memory, zeroed out %seenA and %seenB when no longer needed
	- added method get_bag()
	- inspired by Set::Scalar, used typeglob syntax to implement aliases for methods
	- revised POD extensively

	- first version uploaded to CPAN

0.11  Thu Jun 20 2002
	- corrected errors in POD that caused HTML to display incorrectly

0.12  Sat Jul 13 2002
	- major expansion
	- capability to accelerate processing of comparisons of 2 lists 
	  when only 1 comparison method is expected to be called
	- capability to compare more than 2 lists at a time
	- introduction of methods including:
		get_shared()
		get_nonintersection()
		print_subset_map()
		print_equivalence_map()
	- not released to CPAN due to errors in README and Changes

0.13  Sat Aug 03 2002
	- corrected documentation errors found in v0.12
	- released to CPAN

0.14  Sun Aug 18 2002
	- commented out 'use warnings;' to permit module to run on pre-5.6 versions
	- corrected one error in POD
	- removed e-mail addresses of authors of other modules from POD

0.15  Sat Sep 07 2002
	- conformed CPAN addresses of other modules to new structure of search.cpan.org

0.16  Sat Mar 08 2003
	- for each method which returned an array, added an analogous method which
	  returns a reference to that array

0.17  Thu May 22 2003
	- eliminated certain synthetic variables
	- created List::Compare::SeenHash

0.18  Sun Jun 1 2003
	- added methods member_which(), single_member_which()

0.19  Sun Jun 1 2003
	- added methods member_any(), single_member_any()
	- fixed annoying carping messages when running 'make test'

0.20 Fri Jun 6 2003
	- updated documentation discussing changes since v0.17
	- changed names of recently added methods to is_member_which(), is_member_which_ref(),
	  are_members(), is_member_any(), are_members_any()

0.21 Sun Oct 26 2003
	- added functional interface to list comparison functions:  List::Compare::Functional; this required changes in List::Compare::Base::Accelerated and the creation of List::Compare::Base::_Engine

0.22 Sun Nov 23 2003
	- corrected conceptual flaw in List::Compare::SeenHash so as to exclude values in a seen-hash mathematically equal to zero
	- implemented 'unsorted' option for list comparisons

0.23 [Accidentally skipped.]

0.24 Sun Mar 28 2004
	- first implementation of 'multiple accelerated' mode wherein user can request speedier processing of more than two lists when only one comparison among the lists is sought
	- converted test suite to use Test::Simple

0.25 Sun Apr 4 2004
	- continued implementation of 'multiple accelerated' mode; applied to List::Compare::SeenHash and List::Compare::Functional
	- modification of interfaces to methods/functions are_members_which() and are_members_any throughout; items to be tested must be passed (by reference) as an anonymous array rather than as a flat list

0.26  Sun Apr 11 2004
        - List::Compare::SeenHash and associated tests deprecated
        - capacity to pass references to seen-hashes to constructor now 
transferred directly into List::Compare
	- corrections to POD

0.27  Sun Apr 18 2004
	- corrections to POD

0.28  Sun Apr 25 2004
	- implementation of is_LdisjointR
	- correction of error in tests of multiple-accelerated mode
	- correction of error in internal subroutine _argument_checker_0
	- further implication of deprecation of List::Compare::SeenHash is that all the code in List::Compare::Base::Regular, L:C:B:Accelerated, L:C:B:Multiple and L:C:B:Multiple::Accelerated is no longer shared between List::Compare and List::Compare::SeenHash and hence can be taken back into List::Compare; thereby eliminating the 'use base' calls from List::Compare.

0.29  Sun May 16 2004
	- implementation of alternative ('Adlerian') interface wherein a single hash reference is passed to constructor or function 

0.30  Fri May 21 2004
	- documentation corrections only

0.31  Sun Aug 15 2004
	- added methods get_unique_all() and get_complement_all(); added 3335 
tests; repositioned most methods in List::Compare::Base::_Engine to 
List::Compare::Accelerated as they were no longer also being used in 
List::Compare::Functional; other internal code clean-up

0.32  Sun Sep 18 2005
    - No changes in functionality.  Distribution restructured so that modules
      are now underneath the 'lib/' directory.

0.33  Sun Feb 19 2006
    - Documentation changes only.  Support for List-Compare is now offered via
      dedicated mailing list.

0.34 Mon Nov  5 18:35:15 EST 2007
    - Add require 5.6 to Makefile.PL.
