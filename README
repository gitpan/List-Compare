List::Compare - Compare elements of two or more lists

This document refers to version 0.16 of List::Compare.  This version was
released March 8, 2003.

To install this module on your system, place the tarball archive file in a 
temporary directory and call the following:

% gunzip List-Compare-0.16.tar.gz
% tar xf List-Compare-0.16.tar
% cd List-Compare-0.16
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install

If you are installing this module over any earlier version, you may 
substitute the following for the last line in the sequence of commands 
above:

% make install UNINST=1

If you are installing this module on a Win32 system with 'nmake', 
substitute 'nmake' for 'make' in the sequence of commands above.

List::Compare uses the Carp module which is part of the standard Perl 
distribution.  Other than that, there are no module dependencies in 
this version of List::Compare.

Certain methods in this version of List::Compare are included solely 
for backwards compatibility with earlier versions and are deprecated.  
When called, they print warning messages via Carp.  These warning 
messages appear when you call 'make test' as part of the installation 
process, but may be safely ignored.

From time to time the author writes articles discussing List::Compare 
and benchmarking it against different versions of itself and against 
other CPAN modules.  These articles List::Compare will be available at 
http://www.concentric.net/~Jkeen/list.
