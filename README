To install this module on your system, place the tarball archive file in a 
temporary directory and call the following:

% gunzip List-Compare-0.21.tar.gz
% tar xf List-Compare-0.21.tar
% cd List-Compare-0.21

substitute the following for the last line in the sequence of commands 
above:

If you are installing this module on a Win32 system with 'nmake', 
substitute 'nmake' for 'make' in the sequence of commands above.

List::Compare uses the Carp module which is part of the standard Perl 
distribution.  Other than that, there are no module dependencies in 
this version of List::Compare.

Certain methods in this version of List::Compare are included solely 
for backwards compatibility with earlier versions and are deprecated.  
When called, they print warning messages via Carp.  In earlier versions 
of List::Compare these warning messages would appear when you called 
'make test' as part of the installation process.  This was harmless 
but annoying and has been fixed.

From time to time the author writes articles discussing List::Compare 
and benchmarking it against different versions of itself and against 
other CPAN modules.  These articles List::Compare will be available at 
http://www.concentric.net/~Jkeen/list.
